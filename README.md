# Interactive-Visualization-of-Biological-Networks
PLViz (Pathway Logic Visualization) is a web based tool for the visualization, interpretation and analysis of pathway knowledge pertaining to protein models.  In this Visualization, we introduce an exploratory approach that initially provides a choate view of the entire protein model and enables the user to analyze each protein in the model by separately viewing its activation, subsequent protein activations and the interactions of the protein with other proteins in the model. The visual representation of the proteins and the interactions among them is shown using a tree structure. The visualization of this kind of structure is efficiently done using the node-link diagram. In this visualization, the proteins are shown in the form of nodes and the interaction between each pair of protein is shown using a link between the two proteins. For each element of visualization, effective color coding is applied to differentiate different types of proteins and interactions. The dataset used for this visualization includes individual descriptions of each protein as well as each interaction, thus leading to redundancy. In order to reduce redundancy, all the redundant nodes in the data are merged into one unique node in the pathway diagram. The initial global view of the model is smoothly transitioned into the protein-level view to enable further insight into the origin or interactions of a particular protein.
